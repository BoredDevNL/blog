On the 14th of January 2024, what's now 2 years ago...  I decided to start coding a kernel. Why?

I don't really know. I don't regret it though.

I started out with a tutorial on how to make an x64 kernel (which sucked), I was interested in kernel development but documentation is quite scarce or vague. I continued on that tutorial and expanded and expanded, i know it took me months to get a keyboard driver going. But at least i did.

After adding that keyboard driver i quickly expanded to tens of apps, some a bit unnecesary but a lot are very cool. I also tried adding a DOOM port, i messed around trying to get it to work but decided to give up haha.

I also started with a network stack and i got a UDP echo server working and being able to send udp packets (messages) to other devices. TCP/IP is still very much in the works since it's really hard to get working, but i'm getting closer and closer to a proper TCP/IP implementation.

Anyways i just wanted to make this post marking the anniversary of my kernel and to share some parts about the development process of it. If you have any questions on how to get it up and running or have any questions, just mail me at chris@boreddev.nl or message me on Discord.
